## Software Developer 

Eat, Sleep, Code. Over the years I've built up skills in a few areas, with these at the top:

### **Top Skills** 

- 5+ years JavaScript 

- 5+ years NodeJS 

- 5 years React 

- 3+ years Python 

- 3+ years C++/C 

- 1 year React Native 

  

### **Personal Projects** 

When not doing an iternship or working on some school assignment, I'm usually working on a personal project. 
- This is my most current personal project's [code](https://github.com/chrisdel101/markdown): the worlds most complicated markdown editor. 
- [In Development Demo](https://chrisdel101.github.io/markdown/)
- I've learned how wrong my design choices were from the beginning and plan to write a simpler version based on what I've learned.
##### Highlights Include

- [Place Puppy](https://place-puppy.com/) : Used by developers and designers and gets a few thousands hits a month 

- [Formula 1 Cards](https://f1-cards.herokuapp.com): Keeps fans up to date with F1 using a mobile app. **Project in development** (and so is pretty rough right now) 

  
##### **Interests yet to be explored** 

I find myself working on all things web for startups and enterprise level companies. While this is mainly what I do nowadays, I do have other interests:

- Mobile development - _React Native and true native platforms_ 

- AI (for idiots) - _I'm happy using tooling created by experts. I'll never be one of those AI experts myself._ 

- Graphics and 3D animation 

- Signaling and protocols 

  

### Computer Science Student 

  

From art's grad to coding bootcamp survivor, I'm now working towards a CS degree. It's stressful slog. I graduate in 2023. 

  

##### **Academic Focus**  

- Object oriented design 

- Digital systems architecture  

- Algorithm design and complexity 

- Introduction to operating systems 

- Introduction to parsing and programming languages 

- Introduction to networks 

- C++, Scheme, Prolog (I really suck at Prolog)  

  

##### **Interests yet to be explored** 

- Computer graphics 

- WebGL 

- Cryptography 

- Security 

- Signaling and advanced networking 

  

  

### A Former Life 

  

There was a time before code. I used to do things like write and play music.
